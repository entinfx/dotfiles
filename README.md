# Dot files and config files for my dev setup

## Color schemes

Includes 2 color schemes for Vim:
* Luna (dark)
* Dawn (bright)

All colorscheme files are designed for a 256-color terminal. Make sure to match
your terminal background color to the Vim background color (`ctermbg` of color
group 'normal' in <colorscheme>.vim).
